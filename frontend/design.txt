Use a monochrome, “technical notebook” aesthetic: mostly grayscale with no bright accents, thin hairline borders, and subtle paper-like noise in the background. Rely on a single monospace font for everything, using only size and weight for hierarchy. Put section labels in ALL-CAPS on dark rectangular tags, with generous letter-spacing to feel like console headers. Cards and panels are flat rectangles with slightly rounded corners, tight vertical spacing, and minimal shadows (or none). Controls like sliders and buttons are simple, outlined, and unobtrusive; icons are thin-lined and small. Overall, it should feel like an engineer’s lab console or training log—dense information, clean alignment, almost no color, and zero decorative flourishes.
